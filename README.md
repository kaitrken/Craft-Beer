# Craft-Beer
Python scripts for case study of craft beer sales for CareerFoundry Data Immersion course

# Project Objective
To conduct a case study of craft beer sales at a bar in Russia. Analysis derived insights into profits and sales for local and imported beers
through the use of clustering, linear regression, and geospatial mapping. Analysis discovered that customers prefer cheap Russian beer but will
spend more on imported beer, further suggestions are made to conduct a cost analysis for bringing in additional imported beers. 

# Data
Data for the project was gathered from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/podsyp/sales-in-craft-beer-bar?select=Product_range.csv)

Geospatial file is in the file '02 Data'
